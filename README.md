It is easy for individuals to get lost in harsh, isolated environments with extreme negative temperatures. 

However, sending other people to save these individuals comes with heavy risk due to the dangers and challenges of those particular environments and the high probability for the mission to fail and put more lives at risk. 

The Canadian Assistive Rescue Prototype automates the search and rescue robot. It simulates this process to express how robots can work under conditions that are too dangerous for humans. It recieves instructions about a persons general whereabouts, searches a quadrant, then safely returns that person to a central home base. 

This robot is made of Lego Ev3 Components, and programmed with RobotC.
