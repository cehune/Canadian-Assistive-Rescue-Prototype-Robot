We are group 4-18. Our members include [Kevin Wang](https://github.com/kevinjunkaiwang), [Vedha Mereddy](https://github.com/vedhamereddy), Janet Pham, and [Mckale Chung](https://github.com/mckalechung). 

# Purpose
It is easy for individuals to get lost in harsh, isolated environments with extreme negative temperatures. 

However, sending other people to save these individuals comes with heavy risk due to the dangers and challenges of those particular environments and the high probability for the mission to fail and put more lives at risk.
